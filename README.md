# pipo3-research (Ape Escape 3 Research)
A solo project that contains research findings and commentary based on reverse engineering done for educational purposes under Dutch law ([View translation](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/legislation/details/17868)).
The main goal is to use the found knowledge to re-construct the game in question, using its original assets and my own code utilizing the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
The results of which will not be made publicly available, but documented in indirect formats instead (video, sound, plain text, etc).
